ML PROJECT

Identify and classify images that have people wearing glasses and people not wearing glasses.

Use and try different machine learning algorithms for the same to get the most accurate results.

In the field of Image Analysis, research on identification of facial feature detection is one of the most prominent ones.

Classification of the image with glasses or without glasses is the primary task.

Incentives:

At lenskart and various other companies selling sunglasses, to provide an AR view. Automated Immigration centers at airports. Face unlock features in phones.
